# NARS Rust Implementation: Prioritized Translation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the prioritized components that need to be translated from the Java NAR implementation to the Rust implementation. The plan focuses on building a solid foundation before implementing advanced features.

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (High Priority)

These components form the core infrastructure needed for all other advanced features.

### 1. Enhanced Memory System
**Priority: Highest**

**Rationale**: The current HashMap-based memory is insufficient for scaling. The radix tree implementation in Java provides efficient concept indexing and retrieval, which is essential for performance.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Radix tree-based concept storage
- Term-based indexing for fast retrieval
- Automatic forgetting based on activation levels
- Memory capacity management with eviction policies
- Thread-safe concurrent access patterns

**Dependencies**: None

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 2. Advanced Term Operations
**Priority: High**

**Rationale**: Terms are the fundamental building blocks of NARS. Enhanced term operations are required for complex reasoning and efficient pattern matching.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Term transformation framework
- Subterm access and manipulation APIs
- Term normalization algorithms
- Advanced term matching with constraints
- Term complexity calculation and management

**Dependencies**: Basic term implementation (already exists)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 3. Richer Truth Calculations
**Priority: High**

**Rationale**: Truth values drive all reasoning in NARS. Enhanced truth calculations are needed for accurate temporal reasoning and evidence handling.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Temporal truth projection algorithms
- Evidence-based truth revision mechanisms
- Confidence propagation over time intervals
- Truth interval handling and merging
- Advanced truth value functions (deduction, induction, etc.)

**Dependencies**: Basic truth implementation (already exists)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

## Phase 2: Inference Engine Development (Medium-High Priority)

These components enable the core reasoning capabilities of NARS.

### 4. Pattern Reaction Framework
**Priority: Medium-High**

**Rationale**: The pattern reaction system is the heart of the inference engine. Without it, the system cannot derive new knowledge from existing beliefs.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Pattern matching engine with compile-time optimization
- Rule representation and storage system
- Reaction execution framework
- Constraint validation and handling
- Pattern compilation and caching

**Dependencies**: Enhanced term operations, richer truth calculations

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks

### 5. Unification System
**Priority: Medium-High**

**Rationale**: Unification is essential for applying inference rules to specific premises. It enables the system to match abstract rules with concrete instances.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Variable unification algorithms
- Constraint solving for complex patterns
- Substitution application mechanisms
- Occurrence management
- Unification optimization techniques

**Dependencies**: Pattern reaction framework

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 6. Multi-Premise Derivation
**Priority: Medium**

**Rationale**: Most NARS inference rules require multiple premises. This system enables complex reasoning by combining multiple beliefs.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Premise selection mechanisms
- Derivation control policies
- Evidence combination methods
- Derivation filtering and validation
- Derivation scheduling

**Dependencies**: Pattern reaction framework, unification system

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

## Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning Capabilities (Medium Priority)

These components enhance the sophistication of the reasoning process.

### 7. Advanced Inference Rules
**Priority: Medium**

**Rationale**: Implementing the full set of NAL inference rules is necessary for complete NARS functionality.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Complete NAL-1 to NAL-8 inference rules
- Rule prioritization and specialization
- Rule composition and decomposition
- Context-sensitive rule application
- Rule validation and verification

**Dependencies**: Multi-premise derivation system

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks

### 8. Attention Dynamics Enhancement
**Priority: Medium**

**Rationale**: Attention mechanisms control which concepts and tasks are processed, enabling efficient resource allocation.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Sophisticated focus mechanisms
- Budget management system
- Priority-based scheduling algorithms
- Attention allocation strategies
- Activation spreading mechanisms

**Dependencies**: Enhanced memory system

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 9. Temporal Reasoning Expansion
**Priority: Medium**

**Rationale**: Temporal reasoning is a key distinguishing feature of NARS that enables anticipation and sequence processing.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Temporal sequence processing
- Temporal induction patterns
- Temporal deduction capabilities
- Anticipation mechanisms
- Temporal projection and eternalization

**Dependencies**: Richer truth calculations, advanced inference rules

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

## Phase 4: Performance and Scalability (Lower Priority)

These components improve system performance and enable larger-scale applications.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Memoization framework
- Result caching mechanisms
- Computation optimization techniques
- Memory pooling and reuse
- Lazy evaluation strategies

**Dependencies**: Execution control

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
